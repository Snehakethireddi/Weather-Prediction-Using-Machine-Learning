# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Duration:** April 2024 – July 2024  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Science

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify weather conditions as **"Rainy"** or **"Sunny"** based on meteorological features such as:
- 🌧️ Rainfall  
- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 💨 Wind Speed  

The primary objective is to support agricultural planning and resource management by predicting daily weather patterns with high accuracy.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML algorithms and model evaluation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and standardized the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Trained and evaluated the following classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Tree Classifier

3. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated models using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score
   - Used confusion matrix and classification reports to compare model performance.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Tuned model parameters using GridSearchCV and cross-validation for optimal performance.

## 📈 Results
